# portfolio-brandon

This is a static web-based portfolio with a responsive web design. The portfolio can be accessed from dekstop or mobile devices. The user can also change to dark mode based on preferences. The implementation was done entirely using CSS3 and HTML5 without any additional frameworks.

The content in this code was modified to remove some of my personal information.
